# M & G Bus Website
This repo houses the asssets used to build the M&G Bus website, available at https://github.com/robertAHC/Software_Engineering/

##Tools

This website was built using the [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) text editor.

##Website Content 

The content for the [Website](https://github.com/robertAHC/Software_Engineering/blob/master/README.md) is available in [main]( robertAHC /Software_Engineering )

All main site content is added into the (master) branch and updated as an iterative version. If a change involves a new site element, it will be added to experimental branch (main-experimental). For example, if a fix is made to main branch v1.1 it should first exist as main-experimental v1.0, if it affects all versions, so change can be backported into main if necessary.

As there are no immediate code previews, changes should be tested on one's own machine before committing to main, or put into (main-experimental) for group testing


##CSS 
The CSS for the site is partially built from [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/). Use and installation instructions are available at that link.

##Javascript
Javascript logic is integrated into some elements f the site an is currently hosted in main.

##Publshing the website
The website is temporarily hosted on an experimental platform, but will be ported to GitHub's services in short notice, which will allow more seamless testinhg and access.
